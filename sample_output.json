      "llm_explanation": "The test failed because the error message element '.flash.error' was not visible after submitting invalid credentials. This likely means either: (1) the login form submission is being intercepted before reaching the server, or (2) the error message CSS class has changed in the UI. Suggested fix: Inspect the login page DOM after submission to confirm the actual class name of the error element, and update the selector accordingly. Also verify the form submission is completing by checking network requests.",
